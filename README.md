# 📚 Student Attendance Tracker (PHP + MySQL)

A lightweight attendance-tracking app built with classic PHP and MySQL — simple, reliable, and crafted in the spirit of how things have always been done right. Students can register, add their institutes and subjects, and mark their daily presence with a timestamped selfie. The system quietly handles all the math: attendance percentages, warnings for low attendance, and clean visual reports.
